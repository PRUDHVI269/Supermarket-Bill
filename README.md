# Supermarket-Bill

This Python project is a basic supermarket billing system designed to streamline the shopping and billing process for both customers and store employees. The application begins by prompting the user to enter their name, enhancing the personal touch of the shopping experience. It then presents a list of available items along with their prices, which users can view by selecting the appropriate option.

The core functionality revolves around a user-friendly interface that allows customers to add items to their cart. Each item has a defined price per unit, stored in a dictionary for quick lookup. Users can input the name and quantity of the desired item, and the system calculates the total price for each addition, updating the cumulative total in real-time.

Throughout the shopping process, the system maintains detailed lists of items, quantities, and prices. When the user decides to finalize their purchase, the system calculates the total bill, including a 5% GST, and generates a detailed bill. This bill includes a breakdown of each item purchased, the quantity, individual prices, the total amount before tax, the GST amount, and the final amount payable. 

The bill is presented in a clear, formatted manner, complete with the user's name and the current date and time, adding a professional touch to the receipt. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as user input handling, data storage using dictionaries and lists, and simple arithmetic operations. It offers a practical application for small retail businesses looking to automate their billing process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
